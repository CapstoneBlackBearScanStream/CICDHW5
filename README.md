##Description
The goal of this exercise is to implement a Python package for sorting integer lists using the DevOps software development approach. This package implements bubble sort, quick sort, and insertion sort with performance monitoring using Pythons psutil library. This project demonstrates best practices, including automated testing, linting, and continuous integration across multiple platforms.

## Feautures
 - **Bubble Sort**
 Monitors CPU usage during sorting 
 - **Quick Sort** 
 Measures execution runtime 
 - **Insertion Sort**    
 Tracks memory consumption
